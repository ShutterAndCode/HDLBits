#  HDLBits Verilog Solutions

This repository contains my complete set of Verilog HDL solutions to problems on [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page), a highly regarded platform for practicing digital design and hardware description concepts.

# About the Project

As part of my learning journey into VLSI and digital logic design, I completed a Verilog HDL course on Udemy and reinforced the concepts through practical problem-solving on HDLBits. This repository is the result of that effort — each file demonstrates a hands-on implementation of a core logic concept in Verilog.

# Topics Covered

Here’s a summary of HDLBits sections I’ve completed and implemented:

### Getting Started
- Output basics, simple wire assignments

### Verilog Language
- **Basics**: wire, gates (AND, NOR, XOR, etc.), 7458 chip
- **Vectors**: slicing, concatenation, replication, bitwise ops
- **Modules & Hierarchy**: instantiating modules by position/name, adders, carry-select logic
- **Procedures**: always blocks (combinational & sequential), case/if statements, latches
- **Advanced Features**: reduction operators, ternary operators, generate-for loops

### Circuits
- **Combinational Logic**: truth tables, population count, thermostat logic
- **Multiplexers**: 2-to-1, 9-to-1, 256-to-1 mux design
- **Arithmetic Circuits**: half/full adders, 100-bit adders, BCD adder
- **Karnaugh Maps**: SOP, POS, 3/4-variable K-maps with mux-based implementations

### Sequential Logic
- **Latches & Flip-Flops**: D flip-flops with reset/enable, edge detection, dual-edge triggering
- **Counters**: up counters, decade counters, 12-hour clock, BCD counters
- **Shift Registers**: bidirectional, circular, LFSRs, LUT-based shift logic

### File Structure

- Each `.v` file corresponds to a specific HDLBits problem.
- Files are named to match the original problem title.
- Code is written with clarity and includes comments where needed.
- No subfolders currently — all files are stored flat for easier browsing.

### Certificate

Alongside HDLBits, I completed the **Verilog HDL: VLSI Hardware Design Comprehensive Masterclass** course on Udemy. This helped reinforce foundational concepts and practical skills.
